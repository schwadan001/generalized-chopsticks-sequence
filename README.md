# hello-world

Hi!  My name is Michael Schwalen and I am setting up a GitHub to share some work related to the Generalized Chopsticks Sequence.

See this link for details on the Generalized Chopsticks Sequence: http://oeis.org/A302403.

There are 2 documents in this repository:
1) GC Numbers.xlsx: Excel workbook that generates all GC numbers from through 100 and shares a few insights.  Produced with AJ Robinson.
2) generalized_chopsticks_sequence.R: R code that generates all GC numbers from through 1,000.  Produced with AJ Robinson & code help from Angela Lin

Feel free to use the code and Excel document however you see fit.

Enjoy!
